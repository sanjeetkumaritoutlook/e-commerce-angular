Explanation of the Code:
categories Variable:

This is an array that will hold the list of categories, with each category having an id and name.
constructor:

categoryService is injected here, which is responsible for fetching the list of categories from an API or local data.
ngOnInit() Method:

When the component is initialized, loadCategories() is called to fetch the category data.
loadCategories() Method:

This method uses the CategoryService to fetch the list of categories. The response is expected to be an array of objects, where each object contains an id and name. If the request is successful, the categories are assigned to the categories array.
---
getCategories(): Sends a GET request to the API endpoint (https://api.example.com/categories) to retrieve the list of categories. It returns an Observable that emits an array of category objects.

*ngFor: Loops through each category in the categories array.
[routerLink]: Uses Angular's router to link to the category details page. The link is dynamic, based on the id of the category.
Conclusion:
The HomepageComponent is responsible for displaying a list of categories by fetching them from a service and rendering them in the template.
CategoryService manages fetching the data, either from an API or a static source.
The HomepageComponent uses Angular's ngFor directive to loop through the categories and display them as clickable links, directing users to the respective category page.
This structure provides a clean separation of concerns, with the service handling data fetching and the component handling presentation logic.
