---
Explanation of the Code:
orders: This is an array that will store the list of orders fetched from the backend. Initially, it is an empty array.

constructor: The OrderService is injected to interact with the backend API and fetch the user's order history.

ngOnInit(): The Angular lifecycle hook that is called when the component is initialized. It triggers the loadOrderHistory() method to fetch the order data.

loadOrderHistory(): This method calls the getOrderHistory() method of the OrderService to fetch the order data from the backend. The data is stored in the orders array.


getOrderHistory(): Sends a GET request to the backend to fetch the order history. The URL '/history' can be adjusted based on the actual API endpoint.

The *ngFor="let order of orders" directive iterates over the orders array, and for each order, it displays the order's ID using {{ order.id }}.
Conclusion:
The OrderHistoryComponent is responsible for fetching and displaying the user's order history.
The OrderService is used to interact with the backend and retrieve the order data.
The component displays the order IDs using *ngFor in the template.
