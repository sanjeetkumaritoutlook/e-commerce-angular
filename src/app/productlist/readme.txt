Explanation of the Code:
products Variable:

An array to store the list of products that will be displayed in the template.
constructor:

productService is injected here. It is responsible for fetching the product data from the backend or an API.
ngOnInit() Method:

When the component is initialized, loadProducts() is called to load the products from the service.
loadProducts() Method:

This method calls getProducts() on the ProductService to fetch the product data. The response is expected to be an array of product objects, which is assigned to the products array.
---
getProducts(): Sends a GET request to the API endpoint (https://api.example.com/products) and retrieves the list of products. It returns an Observable of the products array.
--------
ProductListComponent that dynamically displays a list of products using *ngFor, the TypeScript file (product-list.component.ts) needs to:

Fetch the list of products from a service.
Store the products in a class variable.
Display the products in the template using *ngFor and pass each product to the app-product-card component.
---
app-product-card
*ngFor: Loops through the products array and creates a new instance of the app-product-card component for each product.
[product]: Binds the product object to the product input property of the app-product-card component.
-------
Conclusion:
The ProductListComponent fetches products from the ProductService, stores them in the products array, and displays them in the template using *ngFor.
The app-product-card component is a child component that receives a product object as an input and displays its details.
This structure allows you to keep your components modular and clean, with a clear separation of concerns between the product list and the product card.
By using this pattern, you can scale the e-commerce product listing while maintaining readability and reusability in your Angular application.
