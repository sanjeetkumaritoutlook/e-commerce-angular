CartComponent in Angular, where the cart items are displayed and the user can remove items from the cart, the TypeScript file (cart.component.ts) will need to:

Get the cart items from a service (like CartService).
Provide a method to remove items from the cart.
Update the view when an item is removed.
---
Explanation of the Code:
cartItems Variable:

This array holds the list of items currently in the cart. It's populated by fetching the data from the CartService.
constructor:

CartService is injected to interact with the cart data (fetching and removing items).
ngOnInit() Method:

This lifecycle hook is executed when the component is initialized. It calls loadCartItems() to load the current cart items into the cartItems array.
loadCartItems() Method:

This method retrieves the cart items from the CartService and assigns them to the cartItems array.
removeFromCart() Method:

This method is triggered when the "Remove" button is clicked. It calls removeFromCart() on the CartService to remove the item from the cart and then reloads the cart items by calling loadCartItems() again.
-----
The CartService is responsible for managing the cart, including adding, removing, and retrieving items. Here's an example implementation:
getCartItems(): Returns the current list of items in the cart.
addToCart(item: any): Adds an item to the cart. If the item already exists in the cart, it updates the quantity; otherwise, it adds the item as a new entry.
removeFromCart(item: any): Removes an item from the cart by finding its index and using splice() to remove it.

Conclusion:
The CartComponent displays the list of cart items and allows users to remove items from the cart.
The CartService handles the logic for adding and removing items from the cart.
The cart.component.html template uses *ngFor to iterate over the cart items and display them, with each item having a "Remove" button.
